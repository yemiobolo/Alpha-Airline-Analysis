## Introduction
This is an analysis of an Airline called the Alpha Airline that I recently completed. The project involves data extraction, cleaning, analysis and visualization to derive actionable insights and answer crucial questions in order to help the store make data driven decisions, using Microsoft Excel. This project has helped to enhance my data analytics skills.

## Business Problem
1. How many flights use the A319 aircraft?
2. What is the most common type of aircraft across all flights?
3. Show the total revenue per aircraft type, assuming a 10% tax on all fares.
4. Where are we losing the most money?
5. Where are we most profitable?
6. How many flights are flown from O'Hare (ORD) to Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX)?
7. What was the most popular month to fly to Fort Lauderdale (FLL)?
